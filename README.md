# Heart Disease Classification Problem

This project is about solving a heart disease classification problem using machine learning. The goal was to predict whether a person has heart disease based on various health-related features.

## Problem Statement
- **Objective**: Predict whether a patient has heart disease (binary classification).
- **Dataset**: Includes health parameters like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.
- **Output**: 1 (Heart disease present) or 0 (No heart disease).

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Collection**
   - Used an open dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) or similar sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Checked for missing values and handled them (e.g., mean/mode imputation).
   - Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
   - One-hot encoded categorical variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized correlations using heatmaps.
   - Analyzed distributions of key features (e.g., age, cholesterol).
   - Checked for class imbalance in the target variable.

4. **Feature Selection**
   - Used techniques like feature importance from Random Forest or correlation analysis to select relevant features.

5. **Model Selection**
   - Tried different machine learning models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - KNN 
6. **Model Training**
   - Trained the selected model on 80% of the data (train-test split).
   - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

7. **Evaluation**
   - Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   - Plotted confusion matrix and ROC curve for better understanding.

8. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Exported the trained model using joblib or pickle.
   - Built a simple Flask/Streamlit app for predictions.

## Results
- Best Model: [Model Name, e.g., Logistic Regression]
- Accuracy: [ 85%]
- AUC-ROC Score: [0.90]
- Key Insights:
  - Features like cholesterol, age, and blood pressure were significant predictors.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn 

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

## Future Improvements
- Address class imbalance using SMOTE or weighted loss functions.
- Explore deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Collect more data to improve generalizability.
- Deploy the model using cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can help predict heart disease, which can assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Further improvements and real-world testing are necessary for practical applications.
